# üìù 2-Day Interview Prep Checklist: Node.js, System Design & DSA

## Overview
This checklist is designed to help you, Rohit, efficiently prepare for interviews focusing on Node.js, System Design, and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) over the next two days. Each day is broken into focused study blocks, practice tasks, and review points.

---

## ‚úÖ **Day 1: Node.js & DSA Fundamentals**

### Morning: Node.js Core & Advanced Concepts
- [ ] Review Node.js event loop, async patterns (callbacks, promises, async/await)
- [ ] Study Node.js module system (CommonJS vs ES6 modules)
- [ ] Practice error handling and debugging in Node.js
- [ ] Review clustering, worker threads, and process management
- [ ] Skim through `nodejs-advanced-interview-questions.md` (focus on Core Concepts, Async Programming, Modules)

### Afternoon: DSA Core Patterns
- [ ] Practice array and string problems (Two Sum, Anagram, Sliding Window)
- [ ] Solve 2-3 linked list problems (reverse, detect cycle)
- [ ] Practice stack/queue problems (Valid Parentheses, Min Stack)
- [ ] Review time/space complexity basics
- [ ] Skim through `dsa-interview-questions.md` (focus on Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks & Queues)

### Evening: Practice & Review
- [ ] Attempt 2-3 timed LeetCode/EPI/GeeksforGeeks problems (mix of Node.js and DSA)
- [ ] Review mistakes and revisit weak areas
- [ ] Summarize key learnings in your notes

## ‚úÖ **Day 2: System Design & Advanced DSA**

### Morning: System Design Principles
- [ ] Review basics: scalability, availability, consistency, CAP theorem
- [ ] Study common patterns: load balancing, caching, database sharding, microservices
- [ ] Read 1-2 chapters from your system design PDF (e.g., "Designing Data Intensive Applications")
- [ ] Skim through `03-system-design-interview-guide.md` (focus on architecture patterns)

### Afternoon: Advanced DSA & Coding
- [ ] Practice tree and graph problems (BFS/DFS, Number of Islands, BST validation)
- [ ] Solve 2-3 dynamic programming problems (Climbing Stairs, House Robber)
- [ ] Attempt 1-2 sorting/searching problems (Binary Search, Merge Sort)
- [ ] Review advanced topics (LRU Cache, Recursion/Backtracking)
- [ ] Skim through `dsa-interview-questions.md` (focus on Trees, Graphs, DP, Advanced)

### Evening: Mock Interview & Review
- [ ] Do a mock interview (self, peer, or AI)
- [ ] Practice explaining your solutions out loud
- [ ] Review system design questions and sketch 1-2 architectures
- [ ] Final review of notes and checklist

---

## üìå **General Tips**
- [ ] Take short breaks between study blocks
- [ ] Focus on understanding, not memorization
- [ ] Write code by hand or on a whiteboard for practice
- [ ] Prioritize weak areas and revisit them
- [ ] Stay positive and confident!

**Good luck, Rohit! You've got this!**
